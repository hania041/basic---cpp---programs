# 🗒️ Simple To-Do List (C++)

This is a basic console-based To-Do List program in C++ that lets users add tasks, view tasks, and exit the program.

---

## ✔️ Features
- Add new tasks (stored in an array of size 100)
- View all saved tasks
- Simple text-based menu system
- Uses loops, conditionals, arrays, and `getline()` for multi-word input

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Arrays  
- Infinite loop (`while(true)`)  
- Input handling (`cin.ignore()` + `getline()`)  
- Menu-driven program
